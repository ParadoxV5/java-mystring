# `MyString`

A Java
[`CharSequence`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/CharSequence.html)
implementation backed by a
[`Character`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Character.html)
[`List`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/List.html)

The backing list determines whether the instance is mutable (i.e. writeable).


## About

This is the difference between `CharSequence` and
[`String`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html)
in a concrete piece of code.

I originally prepared this to keep my Java experience fresh, but as the project develops,
[JetBrains annotations](https://github.com/JetBrains/java-annotations),
[Maven (`pom.xml`)](https://maven.apache.org/pom.html) and
[GitHub Packages](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/publishing-packages/publishing-java-packages-with-maven#publishing-packages-to-github-packages)
& JavaDoc
[GitHub Pages](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-07-27-github-pages-custom-github-actions-workflows-beta/)
via GitHub Actions joined the party too.
